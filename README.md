dataflash-arduino-library
=========================

This is a fixed version of the original "DataFlash" library.  I believe the original is still available under the "DataFlash" library when searching in PlatformIO's libraries.

# Notice
This work was copied directly from the original publisher (who I assume is no longer active since I could not find the original code online).  I have made no changes except ones required to allow it to build.

Use at your own risk.

I do not provide support.

Forks & PR's welcome if you find an issue.

## Installation
`pio lib install "DataFlash Arduino Library"`
